# Summary of Project
## Summary
This is a project that I completed for a Webs Apps & Services assessment. For the assessment, I was provided with a Venues web service project and tasked with creating the Ecents web application and Catering web service.
### ThAmCo.Events
This is the main project of the three as this is the only MVC web application. This project is where everything is managed. You can create Events and reserve appropriate Venues and book Food Menus, create Customers/Staff and add them to Events, and more (all functionality is stated in the functionality section).
### ThAmCo.Venues
This is a web api service that was provided by an external source. This project is used to get the different Event Types, get available Venues for a given Event Type and Date, and to actually reserve and unreserve a Venue for a given Event.
### ThAmCo.Catering
This is a web api service that I created to handle all of the Catering tasks for an Event. This project allows you to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on Food Menus and also book and unbook Food Menus for an Event.
